Our objective is to use types in functions

In `./src/components/PostList.tsx`, you'll find an anonymous function being declared. Let's use types in those parameters!

Furthermore, on line 16 of the same file, you'll find a new helper method being defined. Let's write it!

Add `./src/utils/formatters.ts` and export the function `formatPostTimestamp`, which takes a single post as a parameter.
